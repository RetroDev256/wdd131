            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <h3>Purpose</h3>
            <p>
                The purpose of this site is to provide an enjoyable pastime game. The game resembles the playstyle of
                <a href="https://orteil.dashnet.org/" target="_blank">cookie clicker</a>. In a real-world setting, the
                game would make money through ad revenue.
            </p>

            <h3>Audience</h3>
            <p>
                The intended audience consists of school children and middle-aged unemployed parents. This target
                audience would be most likely to spend time on an online game, and would be most likely to understand
                the concept and strategy of such a game.
            </p>

            <h3>Dynamic elements</h3>
            <p>
                The game consists of one large "brownie" - which when clicked, increases the overall total of the
                player. The player aims to maximize the number of brownies they have produced. As such, dynamic elements
                include buttons to purchase more workers to produce brownies, which will add a small representation of
                the worker to the page, and subtract the required number of brownies from the total. Additional dynamic
                elements consist of a "news bar" and "settings menu". The news bar displays funny snippets of news,
                related to the current number of produced brownies. The settings menu has options to save and load the
                game. Javascript will enable all buttons to work by adding functions that handle click events for each
                button. Additional JS logic will be in-place to handle the mathematics for the game.

                Welcome to Brownie Clicker! An idle game experience where you aim to produce as many brownies as
                possible. This game is inspired by the classic cookie clicker, and is designed to be easy to pick up. At
                the heart of the game is a giant brownie. Click the brownie to earn brownie points. Use your brownies to
                hire workers who will bake you more brownies automatically! As you progress, you will unlock new types
                of workers, funny in-game news snippets, and other surprises. The more you play, the more brownies you
                get! [This may include alterations as I produce the game]
            </p>

                Workers #1 through #6 have real names and associated images, though it is not made immediately clear
                from the wirefrmae. Each button is a directly coupled to the js behind the game, so it's hard to model
                on the wireframe what it will look like. The worker types won't be displayed if you aren't far enough in
                the game to unlock purchasing them.
